update November 2015 ----- this project is official shut down and may be restarted (not relaunched / restarted) if and when there exists a nakamoto tolerant proof of stake code in c++ I am satisfied with.  There are several other problems with proof of stake other than this mostly security/attack weak points.  

DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE ----------- IT IS NOT SECURE -------- IT MAY WORK AS INTENDED HOWEVER AS I HAVE DONE MUCH MORE RESEARCH INTO PROOF OF STAKE SINCE ORIGINALLY DESIGNING THIS PROJECT I REALIZE IT IS WORTHLESS CODE AS IT STANDS. 
IF YOU HOLD ANY OF THESE COINS I SUGGEST YOU STORE THEM IN A SAFE PLACE, EVENTUALLY IF A SOLUTION IS NOT FOUND FOR PROOF OF STAKE THAT 'WORKS' WITHOUT SECURITY VULNERABILITIES AND DOES NOT VIOLATE THE NAKAMOTO CONSENSUS I MAY CHANGE IT TO A PROOF OF WORK ONLY SYSTEM AND RESTART IT FROM THE NEGATIVE TIME LOCKED BLOCK EARLY IN THE BLOCK CHAIN. 

I HAVE LEARNED MANY THINGS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. 

MY ONLY REGRET IS I DID NOT LEARN THEM SOONER
